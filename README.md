# GlobeLocator
Translate lat/long coordinates to points on an animated 3D sphere with D3.js

Still in early stages, the goal of this project is to develop a lightweight and versatile "global presence map" of sorts.

## v0.0.1

To use, you'll want to update the GET request to retrieve external lat/long data. Local and remote files are supported. You will likely need to update the array indices used for preparing coordinate data as well.
